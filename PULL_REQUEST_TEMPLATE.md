Before you open the request please review the following guidelines and tips to
help it be more easily integrated:

- **Describe the scope of your change i.e. what the change does and what parts
  of the code were modified.**  This will help us understand any risks of integrating
  the code.

- **Describe any known limitations with your change.**  For example if the change
  doesn't apply to a supported platform of the library please mention it.

- **Please run any tests or examples that can exercise your modified code.**  We
  strive to not break users of the code and running tests/examples helps with this
  process.
